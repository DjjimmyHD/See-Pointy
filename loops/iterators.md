# Iteration

* Same style of loops that are available in JS

## For Loops

* Same style as in JS

* Initializer statement (initial clause)

* Conditional statement (conditional clause)

* Final statement (iteration clause)

## Foreach Loops

* used to iterate over items in any enumerable types
  * list, arrays, strings, etc.

* Example:

```(C#)
foreach (var number in numbers)
{
  // do a thing
}
```

## While Loops

* Same same

* As long as the condition is true the while loop will run

* Example:

```(C#)
while ( i < 10 )
{
  // do a thing
  
}
```

## Do-While Loops

* Same same

* Do something as long as the while condition is true

* Example:

```(C#)
do
{
  //do a things

} while (i < 10);
```
